# nodejs-telegram-message-count-bot

This code can be used by admins of telegram groups to create a bot that they can use to monitor the number of  messages 
count/posted of certain users in a group. Admins of the group will have buttons to monitor users message count/posted in the group
and also be able to reset the message count of the users to zero. The users whose message counts are being monitored will also have a button to
be able view their individual message count/posted.

### Note: In order for your bot to work it needs to be added to the group of which users message count is to be monitored (The bots needs to be an admin in the group)
